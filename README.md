# MIMG

A small, multiplatform, didactic image processing library with minimal dependencies implemented in the C programming language.

All the images are expected to have three channels (RGB, no alpha). Maybe this can change in the future. All the dependencies are self-contained and stored in the `/lib` directory

If you want to collaborate, just drop pull requests. That would make me very happy. Please also report as well issues via Github.
